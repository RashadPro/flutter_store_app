# flutter_store_app

ðŸš€ Excited to Share My Latest Project! ðŸš€

Iâ€™ve just finished developing a simple Store App using Flutter! The app allows users to browse and interact with products, and Iâ€™ve integrated API functions such as `GET` to fetch product data and `PUT` to update information.

This project helped me enhance my skills in:
- Flutter development
- API integration using `GET` & `PUT` requests
- Building responsive and user-friendly UI

Looking forward to learning more and building even more complex applications!
